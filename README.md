# Sample

First I apologze for some of the disogranization of my code. Often times, I am the only one who has to read it or work with it, so as I am working through, I leave previous sections commented out in case I need to revert back. However, I assure you my code is robust and flexible, which is why certain classes and functions repeat themselves across projects. I write the object once, properly, and then I don't need to worry about it down the road.

Overall this is a sample of some projects I have worked on.  The first is in the folder ANNproj. There was discussion at a point in my research where it was thought I may need custom tools beyond that which was provided by deep learning packages like Pytorch. To this end, I wrote my own code to develop and train feed forward neural networks using automatic differentiation as well as the ADAM method for optimization of network parameters. I did this to regress a function for a simple periodic data set. This code should run without any special need for packages.

The folder RL_CPC contains the code used for the  publication "Development of algorithms for augmenting and replacing conventional process control using reinforcement learning":

This code is probably the most disorganized given the number of situations and circumstances I needed to model. Fot that, I apologize. It uses a custom virtual environment based on the IDAES package as well as pyomo and pytorch. There are two files, one containing simulation of a flow sheet of a solid oxide fuel cell, and the other of a continuous stirred tank reactor. In both cases, I needed to simulate conventional control, reinforcement learning control, and dynamic modelling of the system under a number of different disturbances and scenarios.

The folder AdvisorAlg contains some of my most recent work. This uses state space models of a selective catalytic reduction unit as opposed to a pyomo model. Here you should be able to actually simulate without a custom virtual environment with IDAES downloaded. However, the functions that contain elements of gaussian mixture models have not quite been worked out yet, so I enourage disabling the special_train and special_exp options if you wish to try see the code in action for training.

Also, I ask you ignore the local pathways for backing up my neural network models and data. This is to ensure in the event of system crash, I can access the information online and the simulation is not lost. Of course, any reference to these will create an error on your local machine
